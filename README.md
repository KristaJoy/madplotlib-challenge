The Power of Plots
Looking at different drug regimens on the effect of tumors in mice.

Includes creating summary statistics for all data, creating bar charts for measurements taken on each drug regimen, creating a pie chart for mouse genders, understanding the quartiles and identifying any outliers in the data with boxplots, creating line and scatter plots to understand the correlation of different conditions like tumor volume and time poins and weight, and finally correlation and regression calculations.
